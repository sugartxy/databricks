## Background
When you need to migrate an old Databricks to a new Databricks, all of the files, jobs, clusters, configurations and dependencies are supposed to move. It is time consuming and also easy to omit some parts. I document the detailed migration steps, and also write several scripts to automatically migrate folders, clusters and jobs.
